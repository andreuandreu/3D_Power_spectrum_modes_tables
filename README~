Explanation of the tables in this directory:
Each file contains the results of a simulation output for the Lyman alpha
transmission power spectrum, at a given redshift output, usually
z=2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8 and 3.0, except for the Eulerian simulation,
which has redshift outputs at 2.9, 2.6, and 2.3.
Each file contains 552 entries, for all the k,mu bins at which the power
spectrum P_F is obtained from the simulation output. The first 296 of these
entries are for k<k_t, where the modes are combined only when they have
exactly the same values of k,mu. The last 256 entries are for bins at
k>k_t, with 16 bins in log(k) and 16 bins in mu.
There are 6 columns for all the entries, which are the following quantities:
1. Bin number (from 0 to 551)
2. k: exp(log(k)), where log(k) is the average value of log(k) of all the modes
     contributing to this bin. For k<k_t, this is just the value of k that is
     equal for all the modes.
3. mu: average value of mu of all the modes contributing to this bin.
     For k<k_t this is the value of mu that is equal for all the modes.
4. P_L: linear matter power spectrum at k, computed at the redshift of the
     output, divided by L^3, where L is the box size.
     The box sizes of the simulations can be 50, 60, 80 or 120Mpc/h.
     It is also and normalized by the mean F of that redshift, given by:
     \bar{F}(z) = exp(-0.0023(1+z)^3.65) as long as is not said otherwise.
5. P_F: transmission power spectrum at k,mu, obtained from the simulation
     output, divided by L^3.
6. w=n_F: number of independent modes contributing to this bin, from all
     three projections of the simulation. This number grows as k^3.
7. error=sigma_P: error computed from the number of independent modes,
   using epsilon=0.05 in equation 3.2.
